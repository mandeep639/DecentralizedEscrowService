# Decentralized Escrow Service

## Project Title
Decentralized Escrow Service

## Project Description
The Decentralized Escrow Service is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates secure transactions between parties who may not fully trust each other. Utilizing Stellar's blockchain technology and Lumens (XLM) as the currency, this service ensures funds are held in a smart contract until all predefined conditions are met. The escrow service guarantees security, transparency, and trust by automating the release of funds based on agreed terms, minimizing the risk for both buyers and sellers.

## Project Vision
The vision of the Decentralized Escrow Service is to provide a trusted, transparent, and decentralized way for individuals and businesses to conduct secure transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries and ensuring the proper execution of agreements. By leveraging the power of blockchain, the service aims to create a global, cost-effective, and secure platform for escrow transactions, eliminating traditional barriers and promoting trustless trading.
